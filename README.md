# B'more Green: Targeting Toxic Waste Releases in Baltimore City 

## Background and Abstract
Baltimore City is home to 35 facilities involved in manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, electric power generation, metal mining, and hazardous waste treatment. The implications of climate change on toxic chemicals make it clear that this is an issue that will affect Baltimore City. Therefore, we sought out to answer the following business question: how can we better understand the future of sustainability in Baltimore City by analyzing toxic waste release and the highest contributing industrial facilities from 2016-2019? Our primary stakeholder is the Baltimore Office of Sustainability (BOS), a Baltimore City agency that implements sustainability initiatives. 

Our proposed solution is the creation of an initiative called “B’more Green'' under BOS. Similar to the Climate Action Plan (CAP) and Disaster Preparedness and Planning Project (DP3), two climate change related plans also under BOS, B’more Green will follow their framework guidelines to specifically target toxic waste release. To streamline our efforts to target the industrial facilities, we will be using the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Waste Management Hierarchy. The ultimate goal is to increase the proportion of source reduction and recycling combined being used to 60% within facilities by 2030. The concrete steps to achieve this will be through accountability of facilities through Environmental Control Board (ECB) citations and fines, shift to more efficient systematic recycling process, and educational advocacy to include community engagement. B’more Green holds great promise for an optimistic outlook on the future of Baltimore City. Without the analysis and our proposed future steps, there will be continued unaddressed adverse health effects and unknown long-term environmental consequences.
